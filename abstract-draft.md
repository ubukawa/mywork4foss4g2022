Vector tile has been one of the key topics in the web mapping. Thanks to the pioneers who have contributed a lot to open source development in the filed of vector tile, we can now develop our geospatial information service with open source vector tile technique. 
UN Vector Tile Toolkit, or UNVT, was established in 2018 under the UN Open GIS Initiative, and has provided various tools to facilitate the production and use of vector tiles. UNVT grows with the global partnership among United Nations and various contributors, and now we have various experience in (1) production, (2) styling, (3) hosting, (4) optimizing, and (5) consuming vector tiles.

In out talk, through introducing our experiences and lessons from selected projects, we will share how we can create vector tiles and their map application using open-source tools including UNVT.
