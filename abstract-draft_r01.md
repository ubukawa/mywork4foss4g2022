Vector tile has been one of the key topics in the web mapping. Thanks to the pioneers who have contributed a lot to open source development in the field of vector tile, we can now develop our geospatial information service with open source vector tile technique. 
UN Vector Tile Toolkit, or UNVT, was established in 2018 under the UN Open GIS Initiative, and has provided various tools to facilitate the production and use of vector tiles. UNVT grows with the global partnership among United Nations and various contributors, and now we have various experience in (1) producing, (2) styling, (3) hosting, (4) optimizing, and (5) consuming vector tiles.

In out talk, through introducing our experiences and lessons from selected projects, we will share how we can create vector tiles and their map application using open-source tools including UNVT. 
We will introduce our experiences such as vector tile production and update of the whole globe for UN purpose, development and use of our style tool named unvt/charites, development of an interface with Esri's geoportal, UNVT application in a sigle board PC (Raspberry Pi), development of storytelling map with UNVT, efforts of 3D visualization.
